Created a data gathering tool that collated NFT traits from crabada.com's API using RESTful API methods with Python3 and Sqlite3. 
Gathered the NFT ID's from a csv file and gathered certain characteristics from the API. 
The program iterated through all the ID's from the CSV file and placed the data in a database using Sqlite3.
Made sure to remove duplicates in the input data to decrease runtime and have a more efficient program.
